Project Blastorium:Recoded

A practice game by Joshua "Vot1_Bear" Aristo
Made in C++, using Microsoft Visual C++ Express 2010 with SFML and rapidXML library.

Progress is tracked on Vot1bear.blogspot.com, including a .zip of each version.
To use the .zip from the blog, extract it to an external folder and run the .exe

To try the game based on the Git files, make sure the sounds/images/data/fonts folder is in the same directory as the .exe, and run.

Credits included inside.

This project is a practice project made with minimum knowledge in programming, so it is unrecommended to use it for studying purposes
If you have any feedback/ideas/bug reports, however, feel free to contact me.
